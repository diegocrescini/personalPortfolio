# personalPortfolio
Portfolio objectives:

1. Personal portfolio
2. FOUR responsive landing sites to add to the portfolio
3. FOUR JavaScript projects
See how far I can get with 100 hours of code, not counting actual studying and learning. 

# portfolio-log

Jun 27 2021 - 1 hour.
Moved some files around to prepare for this. 
Added website-haken-band dir (first "real" website project) and website-diegocrescini 
(really raw first personal portfolio draft from my work in freeCodeCamp)  into this repo.
